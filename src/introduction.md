Hold on 🖐️ that was ChatGPT getting ahead of itself!

## Who are we 🥚🐣

This preface is the only section written entirely us. Otherwise, we mostly played the part of prompt engineers and reviewers to our co-author 🚀

[Gauthier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauthier-schall-0ab74288/) and [Yashas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yashas-vaidya/) are Dataikers by day and perpetual seekers of knowledge at all times. We began writing this book as Developer Advocates in early-2023. ChatGPT's release meant AI, a buzzword from our industry, invaded everyday conversation and public consciousness. We started to explore its intricacies and absurdities by generating a book on a familiar topic: operationalizing models, or **MLOps** *for short*.

## What's in the book for the reader 🎁📖

Our experiences helping teams apply Machine Learning and automation inspired this book. We've worked with public organizations and private-sector companies globally, from among the largest ones to others at the startup stage. We wanted to translate our ~~prompts~~ insights about the technical aspects of MLOps into plain English.

We also hope reading generative AI content is as enlightening as _writing_ it. The book might give you a glimpse into the future of AI and its place in our world. Whether you're in a career navigating the waves of digital transformation, an educator looking to understand its applications or a policymaker grappling with its many societal implications!

## Who is our co-author 🤖🦾

Directing ChatGPT, a worthy third author, was a unique challenge. We had to nudge it frequently in the right direction. Common concerns regarding AI-generated content are hallucinations and inaccuracies. Our biggest challenge was steering it to write precisely, with the right details and the intended tone.

For example, ChatGPT had an interesting take on its abilities for the Preface:   
> With an appetite for data and a knack for number crunching, AI helps bring a unique perspective to this book. While AI might not be able to play the guitar or enjoy a good cup of coffee, it compensates by devouring gigabytes of data for breakfast and generating insights at lightning speed!

## *I will never have time to read another MLOps book* 🧠

AI can *definitely* make music. And maybe soon, it can discern good coffee from bad--for breakfast! However, it can't yet be as creative as humans and in an intentional way. So let's explore this evolving landscape and the promise/limits of AI-generated content via this new **digital artifact**! 

But you might worry! How long will it take to read a book written by a digital mind trained on all the world's data!? We have worked hard on making it short and to the point. Imagine it as time well spent during 3 office commutes. Or the perfect excuse to sip several nice flat whites in your favorite cafe! You will become knowledgeable on MLOps in no time 😎

## Get in touch

If you have comments and feedback or spot a hallucination or few, we'd love to hear from you 🙌
