*Say hello to our trio of authors: two curious humans and an Artificial Intelligence, all equally passionate about the fascinating world of MLOps!*

Hold on 🖐️ that was ChatGPT getting ahead of itself.

This preface is the only section written entirely by the human co-authors. Otherwise, we were mostly prompt engineers 🚀

## Who are we 🥚🐣

We, Yashas and Gauthier, are Dataikers by day and are both seekers of knowledge at all times. 

We began writing this book as Developer Advocates circa early-2023. The release of ChatGPT meant AI, a buzzword from our industry, invaded everyday conversation and the public consciousness. We started to explore its intricacies and absurdities by generating a book. We chose a subject dear to us: operationalizing models, or **MLOps** *for short*.

Our experiences helping teams apply Machine Learning and automation globally inspired this book. We've worked with public and private organizations and companies that are among the largest in the world and with others at the startup stage.

We hope reading an AI-generated book will be as enlightening to our audience as it was to us while *writing* it. Whether you're in a career navigating the waves of digital transformation, an educator looking to understand the applications of AI or a policymaker grappling with its societal implications, we hope it'll give you a glimpse into the future.

## Meet our co-author 🤖🦾

ChatGPT (it) was a worthy third author, yet directing it wasn't straightforward. It ate up the prompts, lots of them. To ensure it went in the right direction, we had to write and re-write them. 

Common concerns regarding AI-generated content are hallucinations and inaccuracies. Our biggest challenge lay in steering it to write with precision: giving the right amount of details and maintaining the intended tone.

For example, ChatGPT had an interesting take on its abilities for the Preface:   
> With an appetite for data and a knack for number crunching, AI helps bring a unique perspective to this book. While AI might not be able to play the guitar or enjoy a good cup of coffee, it compensates by devouring gigabytes of data for breakfast and generating insights at lightning speed!

Generative AI can definitely make music. And maybe soon, it can discern good coffee from bad. However, it can't yet be as creative as humans, especially in an intentional way. So we bring you a new kind of co-author. Via this digital artifact, the promise and limits of generative AI, let's explore this evolving landscape of AI-generated content!
