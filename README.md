*Say hello to our trio of authors: two curious humans and an Artificial Intelligence, all equally passionate about the fascinating world of MLOps!*

Hold on 🖐️ that was ChatGPT getting ahead of itself.

We used prompts to generate this book, lots of them. This preface is the only section written entirely by the human co-authors, also known as prompt engineers.

## Who are we

We, Yashas and Gauthier, are Developer Advocates by day and are both seekers of 
knowledge at all times. We began writing this book to explore the intricacies of generating a book. So we chose a subject dear to us: operationalizing models or MLops in short. Our experiences in applying automation for teams around the world have inspired this book. We've worked with public and private organizations and companies that are among the largest in the world and at the startup stage.

We hope this reading an AI-generated book will be as enlightening to our audience as it was to us while *writing* it. Whether you're a in career navigating the waves of digital transformation, an educator looking to understand the applications of AI or a policymaker grappling with the societal implications of these technologies, we hope it'll give you a glimpse into the future.

## Meet our co-author 🦾

ChatGPT (it) was a worthy third author, yet directing it wasn't straightforward. To ensure it went in the right direction, we had to write and re-write the prompts. Common concerns regarding AI-generated content are hallucinations and inaccuracies. Our biggest challenge lay in steering it to write with precision: giving the right amount of details and maintaining the intended tone.

For example, ChatGPT had an interesting take on its abilities for the Preface:   
> With an appetite for data and a knack for number crunching, AI helps bring a unique perspective to this book. While AI might not be able to play the guitar or enjoy a good cup of coffee, it compensates by devouring gigabytes of data for breakfast and generating insights at lightning speed!

Generative AI can definitely make music. And maybe soon, it'll be able to discern good coffee from bad. However, it can't yet be as creative as humans, especially in an intentional way. So we bring you a new kind of digital artifact to explore the promise and limits of generative AI. Welcome to the era of generated collective knowledge 🚀 

LLMs (Large Language Models) offer an exciting breakthrough in knowledge generation. All of us are grappling with the most effective ways to harness them. Let's explore this evolving landscape of AI-generated content!
