*Say hello to our trio of authors: two curious humans and an Artificial Intelligence, all equally passionate about the fascinating world of MLOps!*

Hold on! That was ChatGPT getting ahead of itself 🖐️

## Who are we 🥚🐣

This preface is the only section written entirely by the human co-authors. Otherwise, we mostly played the part of prompt engineers and reviewers to our co-author 🚀

We, Yashas and Gauthier, are Dataikers by day and are both seekers of knowledge at all times. We began writing this book as Developer Advocates circa early-2023. The release of ChatGPT meant AI, a buzzword from our industry, invaded everyday conversation and the public consciousness. We started to explore its intricacies and absurdities by generating a book. We chose a subject dear to us: operationalizing models, or **MLOps** *for short*.

## What's in the book for the reader 🎁📖

Our experiences helping teams apply Machine Learning and automation globally inspired this book. We've worked with public organizations and private-sector companies, from those among the largest in the world to others at the startup stage. If you're looking for a book willing to dive into the technical aspects of MLOps in plain English, this is one for you.

Also, we hope reading an AI-generated book is as enlightening as _writing_ it. Whether you're in a career navigating the waves of digital transformation, an educator looking to understand the applications of AI or a policymaker grappling with its societal implications, reading this book will give you a glimpse into the future.

## Who is our co-author 🤖🦾

ChatGPT was a worthy third author, yet directing it wasn't straightforward. It ate up the prompts, lots of them. To ensure it went in the right direction, we had to nudge it frequently. Common concerns regarding AI-generated content are hallucinations and inaccuracies. Our biggest challenge lay in steering it to write with precision: giving the right amount of details and maintaining the intended tone.

For example, ChatGPT had an interesting take on its abilities for the Preface:   
> With an appetite for data and a knack for number crunching, AI helps bring a unique perspective to this book. While AI might not be able to play the guitar or enjoy a good cup of coffee, it compensates by devouring gigabytes of data for breakfast and generating insights at lightning speed!

## Get in touch 

Generative AI can *definitely* make music. And maybe soon, it can discern good coffee from bad. However, it can't yet be as creative as humans, especially in an intentional way. Let's explore this evolving landscape and the promise/limits of AI-generated content via this new **digital artifact**!
